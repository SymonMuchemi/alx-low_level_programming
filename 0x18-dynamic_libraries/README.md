# 0x18. C - Dynamic libraries

This repository is a part of my learning journey in understaing the following about dynamic libraries in C as implemented in Unix operating systems:
    - what a dynamic library is
    - how a dynamic library is created
    - how a dynamic library is used
    - what the environment variable `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is and how it is used
    - the difference between static and dynamic libraries
    - the basic usage of the following commands:
        1. `nm`
        2. `ldd`
        3. `ldconfig`
