    - what they are
    - how to use them
    - freeing all nodes in the list

        1. traversal
        2. node creation
        3. insertion at the beginning of the list
        4. insertion at the end of the list
        5. insertion at a given index
        6. deleting the head node
        7. deleting a node at the end
        8. deleting a node at a given
